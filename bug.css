The following CSS rule attempts to style the `::before` pseudo-element of an element with the class `container`, but it's missing the content property to actually add the content to the pseudo-element.  Without the `content` property, the pseudo-element won't be rendered.

```css
.container::before {
  display: block;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: red;
}
```
